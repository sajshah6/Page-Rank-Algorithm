241 Final Project

Description: I successfully created and implemented a version of the PageRank algorithm. The PageRank algorithm is used to rank web pages according to the link structure of the internet. Consider these web pages modeled as a Markov chain with each individual webpage being its own node. By calculating the probability of reaching a node and the links each node contains, I was able to rank the web pages based on their importance. My code takes in an input of a list of websites and a list of links for each website, and it outputs a list of the ranked websites. My code also accounts for dangling nodes and the popularity of each web page.
